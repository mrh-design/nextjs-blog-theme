No recomendations, do your own resources. This is just a list of software I use and find valuable in my role as a project manager.


Introducing the finest selection of small business software, meticulously designed to streamline your daily operations with utmost simplicity and cost-effectiveness.

Now, we all know the essential tools like productivity suites and accounting software, but it's crucial to stay informed about the diverse range of software options available. This way, whenever a new business need arises, you'll be armed with the perfect solution at the ready. As your business expands and you aim to enhance communication and collaboration with employees, customers, and suppliers, having a solid grasp of your software options becomes even more vital.

The beauty of today's business software market lies in its fierce competition. While there are certainly big-name products tailored to large-scale clients, fear not, for there are plenty of smaller, budget-friendly packages that pack just as much punch. Your quest is to unearth the perfect match not only in terms of functionality but also in terms of price.

Surprisingly, even some seemingly high-priced software suites offer a free tier, granting you the opportunity to test the waters and determine if it fits your needs like a glove. And once you witness its potential in action and your business cash flow blooms, you can confidently scale up, taking full advantage of its capabilities. Embrace the power of well-chosen software, and watch your small business soar to new heights of efficiency and success!
